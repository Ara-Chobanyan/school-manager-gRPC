# Steps for the project

1. Split up each micro-service as there own to avoid being over cumbered.
2. Divide and conquer avoid thinking ahead (This could be a issue down the line) and just focus on one micro-service at a time.
3. Make each micro-service be made in a hexagonal architecture to allow future modification with ease.
4. Create individual plans for each of the micro-service.
5. Make sure to do enough research and planning before writing down code.
6. Built up the courage to ask for help on online forums (reddit , stackoverflow etc) if stuck or facing a problem
7. Learn how to use redis and cache data in Go.
8. Create the algorithms for some of the micro-service before coding the code base.
9. Create a dummy database to test out the code
10. Finally don't give up and keep on moving forward.
